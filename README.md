# Day-Planner
### 1.Description: 
This is a functioning daily planner. It logs in events from the user into the time slots that they want to fill. The time slots are color coded for convenience for the user to see what is active, will be active and what has past. Once the user fills in data into the time slot's textarea, then the user has the option to save their data to the local storage and it will persist even on page load. If they want to clear, a clear button and function has been added.

### 2.My Role:
I am responsible for all of the functionality and meeting the user story and acceptance criteria that I was presented. I also adjusted the design of the page to be more aesthetically pleasing.
